Machine learning–based fraud detection system for e-commerce and bank transactions, addressing severe class imbalance, behavioral patterns, geolocation analysis, and model explainability using SHAP.
# Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Bank Transactions

## Overview
This project focuses on improving fraud detection for e-commerce and bank credit transactions using machine learning. The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent activities while balancing security and user experience.

Two datasets are used:
- E-commerce transaction data with behavioral and geolocation features
- Bank credit card transactions with anonymized PCA features

The project addresses severe class imbalance and emphasizes explainable AI.
