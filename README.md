## Model Selection Strategy

Multiple classification models were evaluated using cross-validated ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. Logistic Regression served as a baseline due to interpretability, while Random Forest demonstrated superior performance in detecting fraudulent transactions. Based on consistent cross-validation results, Random Forest was selected as the final model.
